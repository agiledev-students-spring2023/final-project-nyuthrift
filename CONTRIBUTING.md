# Git workflow 
Our group will be following a "feature branch" version control workflow. All of our commits will me made in isolated branches, and merged into the main with approval from other members. 

# Team values

## How we work together
Our team will operate both remotely and in-person. With at minimum, one in person meeting once a week to discuss the project in detail and go over the work done that week. 

## Conflict Resolution 
The team will operate democratically, with conflicts and decisions handled and resolves by the collective whole of the group. Individuals with ideas about their app will present them to the group, which will the deliberate over the decision to implement it. Members are expected to respond to messages within a few hours unless given good reason prior. 

## What if a member fails to deliver? 
If members are failing to deliver on their obligations, we expect a good communication on what circumstances are causing this, and try to find a solution. 

# Sprint Cadence 
Our sprints will take 2 weeks each. 

# Daily Standups 
We expect daily standups over zoom/discord for about 5-10 minutes. Members will be honest about who shows up to every standup, but also be understanding if a member gave prior notice that they can't attend the meeting. However, if a member misses their standups twice or more in a row will be reported to management. 

# Coding Standards 

## IDE
We will all be using vs code. 

## Committing Messages 
We are all expected to keep code clean and working before pushing it. 

# Conctributing 

We will be mindful of making merge conflicts by not merging or pushing without consulting other members. Members should only contribute code on features/tasks that they have been assigned or chosen to do.
