# Project Repository


## Product Vision Statement 
Our project aims to provide a centralized platform for NYU students to buy and sell different goods, such as clothing, textbooks, furniture, etc. Furthermore, our vision is that NYU students will be able to seamlessly find products that are essential to them, and/or list their own goods that they no longer need, for other NYU students. 

## Description 

NYUThrift will allow users to create their own listings to sell any new/used goods that they no longer need. Upon viewing another person's listing, the user will be able to either buy the product for the listed price, or they can make an offer to negotiate the seller's original price. The user and seller can enter chat conversations, to finalize details about the price and how/where the money/goods will be exchanged in person. In addition, the user can search for specific goods that they want, and they are able to filter and sort the products for a more detailed search. Finally, NYUThrift will give personalized recommendations of product listings that the user may be interested in.

## Story behind NYUThrift + How to Contribute 
We realized that there is no central platform for NYU students to buy/sell their own goods. Upon logging into Facebook and Instagram, we saw that there are a lot of NYU students looking to buy/sell goods. Often times, students will post an Instagram story or Facebook post about selling their furniture before moving out, selling textbooks for a class they just completed, or selling old clothes they no longer need. However, this process of buying and selling goods is disorganized, as many users viewing these posts aren't interested, or these posts eventually disappear in users' feeds. Therefore, we wanted to build a platform where the demographic of users is specifically focused on NYU students trying to buy and sell goods.

## Instructions For Building And Testing 
Fork this repository and clone it on your local machine. Once inside the project's root directory, open the terminal and change your directory to the 'back-end' folder (cd back-end/). Once inside this folder, enter the command 'npm install' in your terminal to install all of our project's dependencies. Then, enter the command 'npm start' in your terminal to start the server. 

*For the back end sprint, make sure to start up the back-end server before the front-end server

After your server is up and running, open a new instance of your terminal and change your directory to the 'front-end' folder. Once inside this folder, enter the command 'npm install' in your terminal to install the proper dependencies. Since MaterialUI doesn't seem to have complete React 18 compatability, you may need to do 'npm install --force'. After these installations are complete, enter the command 'npm start', which will open up our project's frontend in your browser.
